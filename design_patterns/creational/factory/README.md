# Factory

- Create object using a method without exposing creation logic.
- User doesnot know how the object is being created.
- User doesnot specify exact class of object that needs to be created.

## When to use

- seperation of creation logic of object
- many conditions like `if`/`else` to decide which object to create
- not sure which implementation of interface to execute
